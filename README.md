Crop Yield Prediction and Optimization

This repository contains a complete end-to-end project on crop yield prediction and optimization, built in two major phases:

Comparative analysis of 8 machine learning regression models
GRU deep learning model
The aim is to evaluate how normal ML algorithms perform compared to a deep learning architecture that learns sequential patterns in agricultural data.
